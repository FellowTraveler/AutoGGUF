    - Downloading llama.cpp releases
    - Generating importance matrices
    - Converting and exporting LoRA models
    - Managing quantization tasks
    - Converting Hugging Face models to GGUF format

    The GUI allows users to interact with these features in an intuitive way, providing
    options for model selection, quantization parameters, and task management.

    Attributes:
        logger (Logger): Instance of the Logger class for logging operations.
        ram_bar (QProgressBar): Progress bar for displaying RAM usage.
        cpu_label (QLabel): Label for displaying CPU usage.
        gpu_monitor (GPUMonitor): Widget for monitoring GPU usage.
        backend_combo (QComboBox): Dropdown for selecting the backend.
        model_tree (QTreeWidget): Tree widget for displaying available models.
        task_list (QListWidget): List widget for displaying ongoing tasks.
        quant_threads (list): List to store active quantization threads.

    The class also contains numerous UI elements for user input and interaction,
    including text inputs, checkboxes, and buttons for various operations.
